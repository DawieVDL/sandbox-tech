# How to build Sandbox Tech
1. Go to Windows/VisualStudio and open quakespasm.vcxproj
2. Right click 'sandbox' and click 'Build'

# Warning
You need pak0.pak in order to play quake on this engine you will need a "core" directory containing that pak file.
Sandbox tech runs quake mods the same way the original quake does you use "game" command and then you specify another directory to run a mod.
